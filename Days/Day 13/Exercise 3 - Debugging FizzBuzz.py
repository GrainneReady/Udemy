# This program is to do with Udemy's Day 13 of 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022

# Instructions:
#   Read this the code in main.py
#   Spot the problems üêû.
#   Modify the code to fix the program.
#   No shortcuts - don't copy-paste to replace the code entirely with a working solution.
#   The code needs to print the solution to the FizzBuzz game.
#   Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.
#   When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".
#   When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".
#     And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"
