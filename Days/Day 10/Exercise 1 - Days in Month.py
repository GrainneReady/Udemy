# This program is a direct copy of a program I made following Udemy's Day 10 of 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022
#   https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/
# Exercise Link:
#   https://app.codingrooms.com/management/assignments/365233/overview
# Instructions:
#   In the starting code, you'll find the solution from the Leap Year challenge. First, convert this function is_leap() so that instead of printing "Leap year." or "Not leap year." 
#   it should return True if it is a leap year and return False if it is not a leap year.
#   You are then going to create a function called days_in_month() which will take a year and a month as inputs
#   The List month_days contains the number of days in a month from January to December for a non-leap year. A leap year has 29 days in February.
# Expected Input:
#   Enter a Year: 2022
#   Enter a Month: 2
# Expected Output:
#   28
# Submission Result (100%)
