# Assignment Link:
#   https://app.codingrooms.com/management/assignments/364928/overview
# Instructions:
#   You are going to write a program that will select a random name from a list of names. The person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill.
#   Important: You are not allowed to use the choice() function.
#   Line 8 splits the string names_string into individual names and puts them inside a List called names. For this to work, you must enter all the names as names followed
#     by comma then space. e.g. name, name, name
#   When you run the code, just use a random number as the seed. e.g. 67346 It doesn't matter what you chose, it's only for our testing code to check your work.
# Example Input:
#   Angela, Ben, Jenny, Michael, Chloe
# Example Output:
#   Michael is going to buy the meal today!
