# I have originally made pong as part of CSU11013 Programming Project in Junior Freshman of Integrated Computer Science in Trinity College,
#   We used processing 3.0 and java to do it, this python version is far much more simpler, and was made to be in sync with the instructor's teachings.
# I plan to add my projects from CSU11013 to my github so that the more complex version of Pong along with some of my other projects can be seen
