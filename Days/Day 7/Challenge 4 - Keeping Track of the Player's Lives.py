# This program is a direct copy of a program I made following Udemy's Day 7 of 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022
#   https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/
# Challenge Link:
#   https://replit.com/@appbrewery/Day-7-Hangman-4-Start#main.py
# Instructions:
#   TODO-1: - Create a variable called 'lives' to keep track of the number of lives left.
#   TODO-2: - If guess is not a letter in the chosen_word,
#             Then reduce 'lives' by 1.
#             If lives goes down to 0 then the game should stop and it should print "You lose."
#   TODO-3: - print the ASCII art from 'stages' that corresponds to the current number of 'lives' the user has remaining.
# Updated Flow Chart:
