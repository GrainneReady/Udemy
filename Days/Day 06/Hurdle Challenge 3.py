# Instructions:
#   Reeborg has entered a hurdle race. Make him run the course, following the path shown.
#   The position and number of hurdles changes each time this world is reloaded.
# Goal to Achieve:
#   The final position of the robot must be (x, y) = (13, 1)
# What you need to know:
#   The functions move() and turn_left().
#   The conditions front_is_clear() or wall_in_front(), at_goal(), and their negation.
#   How to use a while loop and an if statement.

#def turn_right():
#    turn_left()
#    turn_left()
#    turn_left()
#def jump_hurdle():
#    turn_left()
#    move()
#    turn_right()
#    move()
#    turn_right()
#    move()
#    turn_left()

#while not at_goal():
#    if front_is_clear():
#        move()
#    else:
#        jump_hurdle()
