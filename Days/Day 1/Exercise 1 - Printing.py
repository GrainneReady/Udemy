# This program is a direct copy of a program I made following Udemy's Day 1 of 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022
#   https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/
# Assignment Link:
#   https://app.codingrooms.com/management/assignments/364784/overview
# Instructions:
#   Write a program in main.py that prints the same notes from the previous lesson using what
#   you have learnt about the Python print function
# Example Output:
#   After you have written your code, you should run your program and it should print the following:
#       Day 1 - Python Print Function
#       The function is declared like this:
#       print('what to print')

# Personal Notes:
#   When we want to use double quotes inside of double quotes, people will commonly use single quotes inside of the double quotes as if we use double quotes again,
#     the program will believe our new double quote marks the end of our previous double quotes. To avoid this we can use "''", instead of """". Or ' "" ' instead of ''''.
#   String Concatenation is the process of appending one string to the end of another String
#     Example: "Hello" + "World" = "HelloWorld"
#   It is important in Python to have proper indentation, otherwise we can expect an Indentation Error.
