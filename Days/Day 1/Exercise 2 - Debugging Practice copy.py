# This program is a direct copy of a program I made following Udemy's Day 1 of 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022
#   https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/
# Assignment Link:
#   https://app.codingrooms.com/management/assignments/364786/overview
# Instructions:
#   Look at the code in the given code editor. There are errors in all of the lines of code. Fix the code so that it runs without errors.
# Example Output:
#   When you run your program, it should print the following
#       Day 1 - String Manipulation
#       String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign. 
#       e.g. print("Hello " + "world") 
#       New lines can be created with a backslash and n.
# Submission Result (100%):

# Personal Notes:
#   The 'SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing' means that the end of your source code was reached before all code blocks were completed.

# The Code we are expected to debug:
#print(Day 1 - String Manipulation")
#print("String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.")
#  print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
#print(("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")

# The new Code when finished debugging:
print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")
print('String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.')
print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")
