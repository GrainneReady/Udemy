# Python Turtle: https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html
#   Imagine it as a wandering turtle with a pen on its back and everywhere it goes, it leaves a line
#   tkinter is what the turtle module relies on to create these graphics
# Tkinter Colors: https://www.plus2net.com/python/tkinter-colors.php
# tim = Turtle()
# tim.shape("turtle")  # Changes timmy's shape to a turtle instead of an arrow, also works for things like circle, square, classic, arrow
# tim.color("DarkSeaGreen4")  # Change color to DarkSeaGreen4, aka #69698B or (105, 139, 105)
# tim.forward(100)  # Move forward by 100 paces
# tim.right(90)  # Turn right by 90Â°

# These next two lines have to be below any adjustments to our turtle
# screen = Screen()
# screen.exitonclick()

# print(heroes.gen())

# Python Tuples and How to Generate Random RGB Colours
#   Tuple (1, 3, 8)
#   List  [1, 3, 8]
# You cannot change the values of tuples like you can in lists
# Tuple does not support item assignment, or any sort of change of items
# Tuples are immutable
# Colors are often represented as Tuples
t.colormode(255)
