# This program is to do with Udemy's Day 30 of 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022 (Instructor-led Course)

# Instructions:
#   We've got some buggy code. Try running the code. The code will crash and give you an IndexError.
#   This is because we're looking through the list of fruits for an index that is out of range.
#   Use what you've learnt about exception handling to prevent the program from crashing.
#   If the user enters something that is out of range just print a default output of "Fruit pie". e.g.
