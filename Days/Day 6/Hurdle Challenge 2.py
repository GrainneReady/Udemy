# Instructions:
#   Reeborg has entered a hurdle race, but he does not know in advance how long the race is.
#   Make him run the course, following a path similar to the one shown, 
#   but stopping at the only flag that will be shown after the race has started.
# Goal to Achieve:
#   The final required position of the robot will be chosen at random.
# What you need to know:
#   The functions move() and turn_left().
#   The condition at_goal() and its negation.
#   How to use a while loop.
