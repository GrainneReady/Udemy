# Instructions:
#   Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number
#   Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder
#   e.g. 86 is even because 86 / 2 = 43
#   43 does not have any decimal places, Therefore the division is clean
#   e.g. 59 is odd because 59 / 2 = 29.5
#   29.5 is not a whole number, it has decimal places. Therefore there is a remainder of 0.5, so the division is not clean.
#   The modulo is written as a percentage sign(%) in Python. It gives you the remainder after a division
#   e.g.
#   6 % 2 = 3 with no remainder
#     Therefore 6 % 2 = 0
#   5 / 2 = 2 x 2 + 1, the remainder is 1
#     Therefore: 5 / 2 = 1
#   14 / 4 = 3 x 4 + 2, remainder is 2
#     Therefore: 14 % 4 = 2
# Example Input:
#   43
# Example Output:
#   This is an odd number
