# Instructions:
#   Make your own "Choose Your Own Adventure" game. Use conditionals such as if, else, and elif statements to lay out the logic and the story's path in your program.
#   To write your code according to my story, you can use this flow chart from draw.io to help you.
#   However, I think the fun part is writing your own story üòä

#   That said if you'd like to continue with my example, feel free to use the text snippets below...
#   Text Snippets from my example
#   'You're at a crossroad. Where do you want to go? Type "left" or "right"'
#   'You've come to a lake. There is an island in the middle of the lake. Type "wait" to wait for a boat. Type "swim" to swim across.'
#   "You arrive at the island unharmed. There is a house with 3 doors. One red, one yellow and one blue. Which colour do you choose?"
#   "It's a room full of fire. Game Over."
#   "You found the treasure! You Win!"
#   "You enter a room of beasts. Game Over."
#   "You chose a door that doesn't exist. Game Over."
#   "You get attacked by an angry trout. Game Over."
#   "You fell into a hole. Game Over."

# Example Output:
#   
# Personal Notes:
#  using .lower() is useful when we want to be case insensitive
