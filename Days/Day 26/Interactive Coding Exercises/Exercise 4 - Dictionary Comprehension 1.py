# Instructions:
#   You are going to use Dictionary Comprehension to create a dictionary called result that takes each word in the given sentence and calculates the number of letters in each word.
#   Try Googling to find out how to convert a sentence into a list of words.
#   Do NOT Create a dictionary directly. Try to use Dictionary Comprehension instead of a Loop.
# Example Output:
#   {
#   'What': 4,
#   'is': 2,
#   'the': 3,
#   'Airspeed': 8,
#   'Velocity': 8,
#   'of': 2,
