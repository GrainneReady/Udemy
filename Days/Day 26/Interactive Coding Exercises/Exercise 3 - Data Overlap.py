# Instructions:
#   ðŸ’ª This exercise is HARD
#   Take a look inside file1.txt and file2.txt. They each contain a bunch of numbers, each number on a new line.
#   You are going to create a list called result which contains the numbers that are common in both files.
#   e.g. if file1.txt contained:
#     1
#     2
#     3
#   and file2.txt contained:
#     2
#     3
#     4
#   result = [2, 3]
#   IMPORTANT: The result should be a list that contains Integers, not Strings. Try to use List Comprehension instead of a Loop.
# Example Output:
#   [3, 6, 5, 33, 12, 7, 42, 13]
# Submission Result (100%)
