# This program is to do with Udemy's Day 26 of 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022 (Instructor-led Course)
#   https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/
# Exercise Link:
#   (The course made a mistake and forgot to add this exercise to codingroom, so we just have the replit links)
#   https://replit.com/@appbrewery/day-26-5-exercise
#   https://repl.it/@appbrewery/day-26-5-test-your-code
# Instructions:
#   You are going to use Dictionary Comprehension to create a dictionary called weather_f that takes each temperature in degrees Celsius and converts it into degrees Fahrenheit.
#   To convert temp_c into temp_f:
#   (temp_c * 9/5) + 32 = temp_f
#   Do NOT Create a dictionary directly. Try to use Dictionary Comprehension instead of a Loop.
# Example Output:
#   {
#   'Monday': 53.6,
#   'Tuesday': 57.2,
#   'Wednesday': 59.0,
#   'Thursday': 57.2,
#   'Friday': 69.8,
#   'Saturday': 71.6,
#   'Sunday': 75.2
#   }
# Submission Result(âœ”): (Forced to use replit tests instead of codingroom, passes all test cases)
