# This program is a direct copy of a program I made following Udemy's Day 8 of 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022

# Exercise Link:

# Instructions:
#   Prime numbers are numbers that can only be cleanly divided by themselves and 1.
#   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number
#   You need to write a function that checks whether if the number passed into it is a prime number or not.
#   e.g. 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by 1 and 2.
#   But 4 is not a prime number because you can divide it by 1, 2 or 4.
# Example Input 1:
#   73
# Example Output 1: 
#   It's a prime number
# Example Input 2:
#   75
# Example Output 2:
#   It's not a prime number
