# Assignment Link:

# Instructions:
#   Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height
#   It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.
#   * Under 18.5 if they are underweight
#   * Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
#   * Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
#   * Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
#   * Above 35 they are clinically obese.
# Example Input:
#   weight = 85
#   height = 1.75
# Example Output:
#   Your BMI is 28, you are slightly overweight.
