# Instructions:
#   Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, 
#   with an extra day in February. The reason why we have leap years is really fascinating, this video does it more justice:
#   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX96xng7sAE
#   This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.
#     on every year that is evenly divisible by 4 
#     **except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100 
#     **unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400
#   e.g. The year 2000:
#   2000 Ã· 4 = 500 (Leap)
#   2000 Ã· 100 = 20 (Not Leap)
#   2000 Ã· 400 = 5 (Leap!)
#   So the year 2000 is a leap year.
#   But the year 2100 is not a leap year because:
#   2100 Ã· 4 = 525 (Leap)
#   2100 Ã· 100 = 21 (Not Leap)
#   2100 Ã· 400 = 5.25 (Not Leap)
# Example Input:
#   2400
# Example Output:
#   Leap Year

year = int(input("Which year do you want to check? "))

if year % 4 == 0:
    if year % 400 == 0:
        print("Leap year.")
    elif year % 100 == 0:
        print("Not leap year.")
    else:
        print("Leap year.")
else:
    print("Not leap year.")
